# mines

A crate providing code that must never be reached!

Note that there exists many alternatives to this crate:

- [void](https://crates.io/crates/void)
- [unreachable](https://crates.io/crates/unreachable)
- [debug\_unreachable](https://crates.io/crates/debug_unreachable)
- [odds](https://crates.io/crates/odds)

I just wanted shorter names for the functions provided by them.
